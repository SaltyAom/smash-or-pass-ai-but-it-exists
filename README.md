## Smash or Pass AI but it exists

Smash or Pass AI is a concept where user can upload an image and AI will reply with "smash" (find attractive) or "pass" (not find attractive) not limited to people, but also objects, animals, and other things. The concept was popularized by [some social media platforms and has been used in various forms of entertainment](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoglaOfficial/comments/1lhj3oc/i_found_an_ai_that_does_smash_or_pass_on_pictures/).

It has been mass removed from the internet due to its controversial nature, and questionable ethics and morality.

This repository aims to archive the original concept and provide a similar experience.
